Here is the processed text:

Łukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin propose a new sequence transduction model called the Transformer, which relies solely on attention mechanisms and eliminates the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks.

Here is the processed text:

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after...

Training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs is significantly less expensive than the best models in the literature. We demonstrate the Transformer's ability to generalize to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing, both with large and limited training data.

Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory and gated recurrent neural networks have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation.

Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures.

Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. 
Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states as a function of the previous hidden state and the input for that position. 
This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequences.

Here is the processed text:

Sequence lengths are limited by memory constraints, which restrict batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks and conditional computation, while also improving model performance. However, the fundamental constraint of sequential computation remains.

Note: I removed the metadata and LaTeX-specific information, as well as reformatted the text to create a coherent paragraph. I also removed the unnecessary words "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-" to make the text more concise and focused on the main idea.

Here is the processed text:

Transformer models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences. In all but a few cases, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. We propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.

The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of several other models, including the Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, and ConvS2S, all of which use convolutional neural networks as their basic building blocks.

Computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions, in these models the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions.

Here is the processed text:

Reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions. We counteract this effect with Multi-Head Attention.

Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is an attention mechanism that relates different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the sequence.

Here is the processed text:

Used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations.

End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks.

Here is the processed text:

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models.

Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure.

Here is the processed text:

The encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations to a sequence of continuous representations, which are then used by the decoder to generate an output sequence of symbols one element at a time. The model is auto-regressive, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

Here is the processed text:

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder.

The encoder is composed of a stack of six identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a simple, position-wise fully connected layer.

Let me know when you're ready for the next portion of text!

Wise fully connected feed-forward networks employ residual connections around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. The output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself.

Decoder: The decoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. 

This is similar to the encoder, with residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.

Here is the processed text:

Masking, combined with the fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.

An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output. The output is computed as a weighted sum

Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Multi-Head Attention

Our attention mechanism consists of several attention layers running in parallel. The input consists of a query, a set of keys, and a set of values. The weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.

queries and keys of dimension dk, values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V. We compute the matrix of outputs as:

softmax(QKT/sqrt(dk))V

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention and dot-product attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1/sqrt(dk). Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer.

much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk.

Here is the processed text:

To counteract extremely small gradients, we scale the dot products by 1 / sqrt(dk). 
Instead of performing a single attention function, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys, and values h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk, and dv dimensions, respectively.

queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional representations. To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product has a mean of 0 and a variance that depends on the components.

Here is the processed text:

output values are concatenated and projected, resulting in the final values. These are depicted in Figure 2.

The model can jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. A single attention head, however, inhibits this.

The MultiHead function takes in Q, K, and V and returns Concat(head1, ...,headh)WO, where headi = Attention(QWQi, KWKi, VVWi).

The projections are parameter matrices.

Here is the processed text:

In this work, we employ parallel attention layers, or heads. For each head, we use a dimension of 64.

The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways.

Here is the processed text:

In encoder-decoder attention layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models.

The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer, all of the keys, values

Here is the processed text:

and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this

Here is the processed text:

Inside the scaled dot-product attention, masking out or setting to negative infinity all values in the input corresponding to illegal connections is a crucial step. See Figure 2 for reference.

In addition to attention sub-layers, each layer in the encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, applied separately and identically to each position. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

FFN(x) equals the maximum of 0 and x times W1 plus b1 times W2 plus b2.

While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. This can also be described as two convolutions with a kernel size of 1.

The dimensionality of the input and output is 512. The inner-layer has a dimensionality of 2048.

We use learned embeddings to convert the input metadata.

Here is the processed text:

We use tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. We share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation.

Let me know when you're ready for the next portion of text!

Table 1 shows the maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity, and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. The table breaks down the complexity per layer, the number of sequential operations, and the maximum path length for self-attention, recurrent, and convolutional layers.

Here is the processed text:

Self-Attention (restricted) O(r · n · d) O(1) O(n/r)

To make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. We add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.

Note: I removed the LaTeX math notation, metadata, and unnecessary details to produce a clean and concise text suitable for a podcast writer.

Here is the processed text:

as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed. In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies. Each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π.

We chose this function because it allows the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions. For any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of P Epos.

because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training. This could be particularly important in natural language processing tasks where input sequences can vary significantly in length.

Why Self-Attention
Self-attention layers are particularly well-suited for this type of task.

Here is the processed text:

Motivating our use of self-attention, we consider three desiderata. One is the total computational complexity per layer, another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, and the third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network.

dependencies are a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies. Hence, we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the

Here is the processed text:

Different layer types. As noted, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires sequential operations.

Here is the processed text:

Length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with state-of-the-art models in machine translations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position.

We plan to investigate an approach to connecting all pairs of input and output positions in a single convolutional layer. Currently, a single convolutional layer with a kernel width less than n does not achieve this. Instead, a stack of convolutional layers is required, which increases the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than other operations.

Here is the processed text:

Recurrent layers, by a factor of k, can be improved by considering separable convolutions. These decrease the complexity, from O(n·d) to O(k·n·d + n·d2), and are comparable to a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, which is the approach we take in our model.

As a bonus, self-attention can lead to more interpretable models. We examine attention distributions.

Here is the processed text:

From our models, individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks. Many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences.

Training Regime

We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million metadata.

Here is the processed text:

Sentence pairs were encoded using byte-pair encoding. The source-target vocabulary had about 37,000 tokens. For English-French, a larger dataset was used, consisting of 36 million sentences and a 32,000 word-piece vocabulary. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length, with each batch containing around 25,000 source tokens.

Here is the processed text:

We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. Each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For the big models, each step took 1.0 seconds and they were trained for 300,000 steps or 3.5 days.

Here is the processed text:

We used the Adam optimizer with beta 1 equal to 0.9, beta 2 equal to 0.98 and epsilon equal to 10 to the power of negative 9. We varied the learning rate over the course of training according to the formula lrate equals d to the power of negative 0.5 times the model times the minimum of step number minus 0.5 or step number times warmup steps minus 1.5. This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup steps training steps and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.

Label smoothing of value 0.1 was employed during training. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.

Transformer Architecture Variations

The model's architecture has several variations, with unlisted values identical to the base model. Metrics are reported on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.

Here are the details of the model:

* N: number of layers
* dff: number of hidden dimensions
* h: number of attention heads
* d_k: dimension of key
* dv: dimension of value
* Pdrop: dropout probability
* ϵls: label smoothing epsilon
* train PPL: training perplexity
* BLEU: BLEU score

* steps: number of training steps
* dev (dev): development set perplexity and BLEU score

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but not in the development set, newstest2013. Instead, we used positional embedding instead of sinusoids.

Checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3. In rows A, we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant. Single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, while quality drops off with too many heads. In rows B, reducing the attention key size hurts model quality.

Determining compatibility is not easy and a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. Bigger models are better, and dropout is helpful in avoiding over-fitting. We also observe nearly identical results when replacing sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings.

To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks, we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input.

We trained a 4-layer transformer with a model size of 1024 on the Wall Street Journal portion of the metadata.

Penn Treebank, about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora with approximately 17M sentences. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.

We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual.

Here is the processed text:

Learning rates and beam size were tested on the Section 22 development set, with all other parameters remaining unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model during inference.

Here is the processed text:

The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing. The parser training results are as follows: Vinyals & Kaiser et al. (2014) achieved an F1 score of 88.3, Petrov et al. (2006) achieved 90.4, Zhu et al. (2013) achieved 90.4, Dyer et al. (2016) achieved 91.7, and the Transformer (4 layers) achieved 91.3.

Here is the processed text:

Huang and Harper (2009) achieved 91.3 with semi-supervised learning. McClosky et al. (2006) got 92.1, and Vinyals and Kaiser et al. (2014) achieved the same 92.1 with semi-supervised learning as well. The Transformer model with 4 layers also achieved 92.7 with semi-supervised learning. Luong et al. (2015) reached 93.0 with multi-task learning, while Dyer et al. (2016) achieved 93.3 with generative learning.

We increased the maximum output length to input length plus 300, and used a beam size of 21 and α = 0.3 for both the WSJ only and semi-supervised settings.

Our results show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning, our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar.

In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models, the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-Parser even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.

Here is the processed text:

In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention. This replaces traditional recurrent layers with multi-headed self-attention. The Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers.

English-to-French translation tasks achieve a new state of the art. Our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text, and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs.

Attention Visualizations
Input-Input Layer 5

It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.

Here is the processed text:

An example of the attention mechanism following long-distance dependencies in the encoder self-attention is shown in layer 5 of 6. Many of the attention heads attend to a distant dependency of the verb "making", completing the phrase "making...more difficult".

The law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.

Note: I removed the LaTeX math notation, new lines, and metadata information, as they are not relevant to a podcast transcript. I also removed the unnecessary words and phrases, such as "Figure 4", "Two attention heads", and "Note that the attentions are very sharp for this word", as they are more suitable for a technical paper or presentation. The remaining text is concise and easy to understand for a podcast writer.

Many of the attention heads exhibit behaviour that seems related to the structure of the sentence. We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention at layer 5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks.
